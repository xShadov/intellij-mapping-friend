Something something = Something.builder()
	.primitive() //required
	.primitiveWrapperRequired() //required
	.primitiveWrapperOptional() //optional
	.complex(complex()) //optional
	.build();
	
Complex complex() {
	return Complex.builder()
	...
	.build();
}

Basic:
1. Delete ; to have it in one line
2. Generate required/optional
3. Support for other 'builder' and 'build' method names
4. Indentation
5. Methods for complex objects (check scope of current if static or not) and then go deeper, filling whole tree
6. Configs for all those options
7. Maybe as a postfix (.builderFill or something, easier to use)



Advanced:
1. Check current code if builders are fully filled
2. Make point 1 as a code inspection during scanning
